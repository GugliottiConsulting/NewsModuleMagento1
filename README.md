# Magento 1.9 News Module

This is a News module to Magento 1.9, developed to be used along Magento classes. It isn't a full module and the use on production environment IS NOT RECOMMENDED. You can use this module to study and improve your knowledge about Magento Commerce.

## How to use this module

Just clone the files into your project folder. After cleaning the cache, logging out and logging in again on backend, the News module should be ready to be used.

This module was thought to be used as support on Magento classes, containing models, controllers and templates that allows the student to see almost everything s/he must know to start to work with Magento 1. Currently, it contains:

* SQL installer, using DDL calls
* SQL upgrader
* models for Category and Story objects
* observers
* controllers for backend grids and edit pages
* controllers for frontend lists and single category / story view
* blocks used to display this information
* main helper
* log helper
* CSV translation file for en_US view
* data install (as an upgrade from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0)
* latest news widget
 
It's a work in progress, so on every new course, this module is updated with new features.

As you can guess, this is not a module to Magento 2. The new version of Magento has changed a lot of things and you can not use it on Magento 2. That said, you can still use this module to study as the main concepts of Magento 1 are a great basis to every one who wants to work with Magento 2.
